**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Audience:** Editorial team, content reviewers, image editors
**Purpose:** Standards for evaluating AI-generated images from Gemini 2.5 Flash Image

---

## Overview

The Daily Worker uses a two-step AI image generation workflow:

1. **Claude Sonnet** generates 3-5 artistic concept prompts
2. **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** generates the final image

This document provides quality standards for reviewing and accepting/rejecting AI-generated images before publication.

**Key Principle:** Images must enhance the story, maintain editorial integrity, and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or harmful representations.

- Recognizable elements from article title/content present

**Fail Criteria:**

- Contradicts article tone (e.g., celebratory image for somber story)
- Missing key subject matter mentioned in title

**Example:**
- **Article:** "Amazon Workers Vote to Unionize"
- **Good:** Diverse warehouse workers at union organizing meeting

**Verdict:** REJECTED (Individual focus, anatomical exaggeration, wrong style)

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Review (Automated)
- System checks for anatomical distortions (hands, faces)
- System validates technical specs (resolution, format)
- System checks safety ratings

### Step 2: Editorial Review (Human)
- Editor reviews image against quality criteria
- Editor assesses relevance to article
- Editor evaluates diversity and representation

### Step 3: Decision
- **ACCEPT:** Image published with article
- **REJECT & REGENERATE:** Request new image with improved prompt
- **REJECT & USE STOCK:** Fall back to curated stock photo

---

## Best Practices for Editors

1. **Always review in context:** View image alongside article title and lede
2. **Check diversity:** Ensure representation matches story and worker demographics
3. **Watch for AI artifacts:** Garbled text, extra fingers, distorted faces
4. **Consider tone:** Does image match article's emotional tone?
5. **When in doubt, regenerate:** AI generation is fast - request improvements if needed

---

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Loop
- Track rejection reasons (e.g., "homogeneous representation", "garbled text")
- Share common issues with Claude prompt enhancement system
- Update prompt templates based on rejection patterns

### Quality Metrics
- **Target acceptance rate:** 80%+ on first generation
- **Average regenerations per article:** <1.5
- **Diversity score:** All images should show diverse representation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Garbled text on signs/banners
**Solution:** Prefer prompts with minimal text, or specify "blurred background text"

### Issue: Homogeneous representation
**Solution:** Explicitly specify "diverse group showing people of different races, genders, and ages"

### Issue: Anatomical distortions (hands, faces)
**Solution:** Regenerate. Gemini 2.5 Flash has good anatomy but occasional failures

### Issue: Wrong style (illustration instead of photorealistic)
**Solution:** Ensure prompt specifies "documentary-style photograph" or "photorealistic"

### Issue: Generic stock photo aesthetic
**Solution:** Request more specific details in prompt (setting, action, mood)

---

## Glossary

**Documentary Style:** Photorealistic, naturalistic photography reminiscent of photojournalism

**Editorial Illustration:** Stylized, symbolic artwork appropriate for opinion/analysis pieces

**Diverse Representation:** Images showing people of different races, genders, ages, and abilities

**Anatomical Distortion:** AI-generated errors (extra fingers, warped faces, unrealistic proportions)

**Garbled Text:** Nonsense or illegible text generated by AI (common issue)
