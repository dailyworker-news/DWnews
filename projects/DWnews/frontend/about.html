        <h1>About The Daily Worker</h1>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Daily Worker delivers accurate, timely news that matters to working-class Americans,
            analyzed through a Marxist/Leninist lens. We don't shy away from uncomfortable truths,
            and we don't pull punches when it comes to exposing exploitation, inequality, and injustice.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quality Over Quantity:</strong> We publish 3-10 carefully researched articles daily,
                not a flood of clickbait. Every article meets our standards for accuracy and relevance.</li>
            <li><strong>Worker-Centric Perspective:</strong> All news is analyzed through the lens of
                working-class interests. We ask "How does this affect workers?" for every story.</li>
            <li><strong>No Corporate Influence:</strong> We're not beholden to advertisers, shareholders,
                or corporate interests. Our only loyalty is to the truth and to working people.</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence-Based Analysis:</strong> Every article cites multiple credible sources
                and includes academic citations where appropriate. We value accuracy over ideology.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p>
            Our content pipeline combines AI-powered discovery and generation with human editorial oversight:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> We monitor RSS feeds, social media, and trusted news sources
                to identify stories that matter to working people.</li>
            <li><strong>Filtering:</strong> Topics are evaluated for source credibility, worker relevance,
                and engagement potential before we commit to coverage.</li>
            <li><strong>Generation:</strong> AI tools help draft articles with proper reading level
                (7.5-8.5 Flesch-Kincaid), always including "Why This Matters" and "What You Can Do" sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Review:</strong> Human editors review every article before publication to ensure
                accuracy, tone, and quality standards are met.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Content Standards</h2>
        <p>Every article we publish must meet these criteria:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum 3 credible sources cited</li>
            <li>Reading level between 7.5-8.5 (accessible but not dumbed down)</li>
            <li>Worker relevance score of at least 0.3</li>
            <li>Engagement potential score of at least 0.3</li>
            <li>"Why This Matters" section explaining broader significance</li>
            <li>"What You Can Do" section providing concrete action steps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>AI-Generated Content Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            We use artificial intelligence tools to help discover topics, draft articles, and source images.
            However, all content is reviewed and edited by human editors before publication. AI is a tool
            that helps us work more efficiently—it doesn't replace human judgment, fact-checking, or editorial oversight.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Principles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy First:</strong> We correct mistakes promptly and prominently.</li>
            <li><strong>No Punches Pulled:</strong> We call out exploitation, corruption, and injustice
                regardless of who's responsible.</li>
            <li><strong>Worker Solidarity:</strong> We support labor organizing, strikes, and collective action.</li>
            <li><strong>Broad Coverage:</strong> We cover Labor, Tech, Politics, Economics, Current Affairs,
                Art & Culture, Sport, and Good News.</li>
            <li><strong>Regional Focus:</strong> National news and local stories that affect working families.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Daily Worker honors the legacy of the original Daily Worker newspaper (1924-1958),
            which covered labor news and working-class struggles during a critical period of American history.
            Like our predecessor, we're committed to telling the stories that corporate media ignores.
