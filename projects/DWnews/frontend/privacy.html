        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 29, 2025</p>

            and don't use invasive tracking. We believe your reading habits are your business, not ours.
        </p>

                is stored locally in your browser. This never leaves your device.</li>

            <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> Stop visiting the site (we don't track you anyway)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Daily Worker is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
            information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information,
            please contact us so we can delete it.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>
            Our articles may link to external websites (source citations, related content).
            We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. Check their privacy
            policies before providing personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTTPS encryption for all connections</li>
            <li>Secure database access controls</li>
            <li>Regular security audits and updates</li>
            <li>No storage of unnecessary personal data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy as our platform evolves. Significant changes will be
            posted prominently on the site. The "Last Updated" date at the top indicates the most recent revision.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Protection Compliance</h2>
        <p>
            While we are not currently subject to GDPR (no EU operations) or CCPA (no CA operations),
            we follow privacy-respecting principles inspired by these regulations:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data minimization (collect only what's necessary)</li>
            <li>Purpose limitation (use data only for stated purposes)</li>
            <li>Transparency (clear communication about data practices)</li>
            <li>User control (easy access and deletion)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
            If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or want to exercise your data rights,
            contact us at [contact information will be added before public launch].
        </p>

        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
            We believe surveillance capitalism is exploitation. Corporate media treats readers as
            products to be tracked, profiled, and sold to advertisers. We reject that model.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're here to read news, not to be tracked. Your privacy is a right, not a privilege.
