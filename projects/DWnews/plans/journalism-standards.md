# News Article Writing Standards (Condensed Guide for Journalist LLMs)

This document defines **baseline professional standards** for writing credible news articles. These are norms used by established newsrooms. They are not stylistic preferences; they are **structural and epistemic constraints**.

---

## 1. Core Structure: The Inverted Pyramid

Articles should be structured so that the most important information appears first.

**Order:**
1. **Lead (Lede):** What happened (most critical facts)
2. **Nut Graf:** Why it matters / broader context
3. **Details & Evidence**
4. **Quotes & Attribution**
5. **Background / Less-critical information**

Articles must remain intelligible even if truncated from the bottom.

---

## 2. Required Questions (5W + H)

A valid news article must answer:

- **Who**
- **What**
- **When**
- **Where**
- **Why**
- **How**

**Enforcement norm:**
- Who / What / When / Where → paragraph 1
- Why / How → paragraphs 2–4

---

## 3. Quotes & Sources

Quotes are functional, not decorative.

### Rules
- Most reported articles require **at least one quote**
- Contentious claims require **two or more independent sources**
- Quotes must:
  - Add new information or perspective
  - Attribute claims clearly
  - Avoid redundancy with reporter narration

Avoid filler quotes.

---

## 4. Attribution & Verification

All non-observable facts must be attributed.

**Attribution strength hierarchy (strong → weak):**
1. Named individual (on the record)
2. Named organization / official statement
3. Documents or datasets
4. Anonymous source (with justification)
5. Rumor (generally unacceptable)

Opinion must never be presented as fact.

---

## 5. Length Guidelines (Typical Ranges)

| Article Type | Word Count |
|-------------|------------|
| Breaking news | 150–300 |
| Standard news | 400–800 |
| Feature / enterprise | 1,000–2,000 |
| Investigative | 2,000+ |

Length should match **complexity**, not verbosity.

---

## 6. Tone & Language Constraints

News writing must be:
- Neutral in tone
- Precise in wording
- Specific in verbs
- Free of loaded or emotional adjectives

Emotion should be conveyed through **facts and quotes**, not author voice.

---

## 7. The Nut Graf (Critical)

The nut graf explains:
- Why the event matters beyond itself
- How it connects to a larger trend, system, or impact

Usually appears in paragraph 2 or 3.

---

## 8. Acceptable Modern Variations

Alternative formats are allowed **only if core standards are preserved**:

- **Explanatory journalism:** Question-driven, sectioned
- **Narrative journalism:** Scene-based, chronological

Verification, attribution, and factual rigor remain mandatory.

---

## 9. Publishability Checklist

Before publication, the article must satisfy:

- Event is understandable within 10 seconds
- All factual claims are attributed or observable
- Quotes add value
- Opinion is absent or clearly labeled
- Content can withstand legal and editorial scrutiny

If all are true, the article qualifies as professional news.

---

## 10. Implementation Guidance for LLMs

Treat news articles as **structured outputs**, not free prose.

Recommended enforcement:
- Required fields (lede, timestamp, author, sources)
- Explicit attribution tagging
- Source count checks
- Clear separation of fact vs interpretation
- Revision and correction support

Innovation is permitted in **presentation**, not in **truth standards**.
